# Pomodoro App

This app is build using qt6.4 with c++. I know this is a chaos, but the app is pretty good looking, at least on Pop_os!

By opensourcing it, I want anyone to have the compile of it and in case they want, contribute and change something. I don't think it is the best code ever, but it is not the worst, it is readeable and does it pupose.

The audio was taken from: [soundboard](https://www.soundboard.com/sb/minions).

The only way I know to compile this code is downloading [qt6.4 install opensource](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html).

1. Install qt6.4
2. Clone this repository
3. Open new project on qt6.4 creator and compile.
4. Get `.exe`, `binary file` or whatever it is on mac and move it to desktop or anywhere.
5. Double click.

Enjoy!!! And I am no qt pro.

Thanks for reading!! : D
